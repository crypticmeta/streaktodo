# Streak Todo

Simple todo + scheduler app with categories, reminders, repeat rules, subtasks, and a clean local-first workflow.

## Design system

`design-system/` contains the visual source of truth for the mobile UI.
Read `design-system/README.md` and
`design-system/project/colors_and_type.css` before changing tokens or
component styling.

## Product direction

Primary reference points from `inspiration/app/`:

- task list with category pills across the top
- quick-add composer opened from a floating action button
- date picker with shortcuts such as Today, Tomorrow, 3 Days Later, This Sunday, and No Date
- reminder settings with lead time and type
- repeat rules including daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and custom
- subtask input inside the composer
- calendar tab with a selected-day task list
- profile dashboard with account summary and task stats
- task edit/details screen with category, reminder, repeat, and notes rows

## Scope guardrails

- No attachment support for now
- No premium gating for now
- No upgrade banners or paywall flows for now
- All implemented features remain free in the current product

## Build plan

### Phase 1: foundation

- [x] Finalize branding: app name, icon set, package IDs, and launch assets — single source in [`branding.js`](./branding.js)
- [x] Define color, spacing, type, and icon tokens for the mobile UI — see [`src/theme/`](./src/theme)
- [x] Set up navigation shell for Tasks, Calendar, and Profile tabs — expo-router under [`app/`](./app)
- [x] Add local persistence model for tasks, categories, subtasks, reminders, and repeat rules — sqlite + raw SQL repos under [`src/db/`](./src/db)
- [x] ~~Create seed/demo data for rapid UI iteration~~ — **deliberately skipped.** Phase 3 (composer) is built before Phase 2 (list), so all data is real user-created from day one. A targeted dev-only fixture helper may be added later if edge-case coverage is needed.

### Phase 2: quick add composer (build first, so the list has real data)

- [x] Add floating action button to open the task composer — see [`src/components/Fab.tsx`](./src/components/Fab.tsx)
- [x] Build bottom-sheet composer with title input — see [`src/components/TaskComposer.tsx`](./src/components/TaskComposer.tsx)
- [x] Add submit action and validation for creating a task — composer persists via `tasksRepo.createTask`, inline error + length-hint surfacing
- [x] Add inline subtask row inside the composer — atomic insert via `tasksRepo.createTaskFull`
- [x] Add category picker trigger — chip in composer + `CategoryPickerSheet` + `useCategories` hook
- [x] Build the rich Schedule sheet (date + time + reminder + repeat in one surface, matching `inspiration/app/click_on_calendar_icon.jpeg`)
  - [x] Calendar grid with month nav — [`src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx`](./src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx)
  - [x] Quick shortcuts: Today / Tomorrow / 3 Days Later / This Sunday / No Date
  - [x] Time field (opens native time picker; null = all-day)
  - [x] Reminder field (opens `ReminderPopover` with on/off + lead time + type + ScreenLock)
  - [x] Repeat field (opens `RepeatPopover` with None / Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly / Custom)
  - [x] Cancel / Done footer commits to draft state, not DB
- [x] Calendar-icon trigger in composer wired to the Schedule sheet
- [x] Extend `tasksRepo` with a `createTaskFull` transaction (parent + subtasks + reminders + repeat rule)
- [x] Product scope remains fully free with no visible upgrade surface

### Phase 3: task list home

- [x] Build the main task list screen — `FlatList` driven by `useTasks`
- [x] Design the base task row with checkbox, title, metadata line, and pin/star action — see [`src/components/TaskRow.tsx`](./src/components/TaskRow.tsx)
- [x] Support task completion with immediate UI feedback — optimistic patch overlay with rollback on failure
- [x] Support pinning or flagging important tasks — `tasksRepo.setPinned` + accent border on pinned rows
- [x] Add empty state and loading state for the task list — plus error state with retry
- [x] Add grouped sections such as Previous, Today, Upcoming, and No Date — see [`src/lib/taskGrouping.ts`](./src/lib/taskGrouping.ts), rendered via `SectionList`
- [x] Add top category pills: All, Work, Personal, Wishlist — see [`src/components/CategoryPills.tsx`](./src/components/CategoryPills.tsx)

### Phase 4: categories

- [x] ~~Build category dropdown from the composer~~ — covered by anchored `CategoryPickerMenu` in Phase 2 (replaced the earlier sheet)
- [x] ~~Support default categories: Work, Personal, Wishlist~~ — seeded on first launch in Phase 1
- [x] Add create-new-category flow — `+ Create New` row in the menu opens [`CreateCategoryDialog`](./src/components/CreateCategoryDialog.tsx) with name input + color swatches; persists via `categoriesRepo.createCategory`
- [x] Add category-based task filtering on the home screen — Phase 3 pills wired through `useTasks({ categoryId })`
- [x] Persist category colors — color swatch chosen at create time is stored on the row
- [x] Category management screen (rename / recolor / delete) — see Phase 10 entry; reorder still deferred

### Phase 5: scheduling (runtime semantics)

UI for date / time selection lives in the Schedule sheet (Phase 2). This phase covers everything else.

- [x] Show scheduled date and time clearly in the task row metadata — `TaskRow` meta line renders date + time + reminder + repeat icons
- [x] Handle overdue styling for past-due tasks — left-edge danger stripe (suppressed for pinned rows) + uppercase "Overdue" pill in the meta row + danger-tinted date text. Screen-reader label includes the overdue state and category name so grayscale/a11y users get the same signal.
- [x] Group tasks into Previous / Today / Upcoming / No Date sections — see [`src/lib/taskGrouping.ts`](./src/lib/taskGrouping.ts)
- [x] Day grouping helper in `src/lib/date.ts` — `startOfDay`, `addDays`, etc.

### Phase 6: reminders (runtime engine)

UI for reminder on/off + lead time + type lives in the Schedule sheet (Phase 2). This phase wires actual OS notifications.

- [x] Enable local notification permissions flow on first reminder save — see [`src/lib/notificationScheduler.ts`](./src/lib/notificationScheduler.ts) `ensurePermission` + `ReminderPopover` warning banner if denied
- [x] Schedule local notifications when a task with reminder(s) is saved — `scheduler.scheduleForTask` in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` `handleSubmit`
- [x] Cancel or reschedule notifications when a task is completed, uncompleted, or deleted — wired into `handleToggleComplete`; soft-delete cancellation still pending until task editing/delete UI ships
- [x] Re-arm notifications on app launch if the OS dropped them (boot-loss recovery) — `scheduler.reconcileAll()` in `_layout.tsx` after DB ready
- [x] Persist `scheduled_notification_id` on `task_reminders` rows — done
- [ ] Optional reminder types beyond plain notification — Alarm and Silent
- [ ] ScreenLock reminder option — display the task on the lock screen / always-on display
- [x] Hide unimplemented reminder UI from the current product surface

### Phase 7: recurrence (runtime engine)

UI for the repeat menu lives in the Schedule sheet (Phase 2). This phase computes next occurrences.

- [x] Generate next occurrence on task completion based on `task_repeat_rules` — `tasksRepo.spawnNextOccurrence` clones the task + subtasks + reminders + repeat rule into the next slot
- [x] Support daily / weekly / monthly / yearly recurrence math — see [`src/lib/recurrence.ts`](./src/lib/recurrence.ts) `nextOccurrence(rule, fromTs)`
- [x] Show repeat status in task metadata — `🔁` indicator already wired in `TaskRow` via `taskIdsWithRepeat`
- [x] Respect `until_at` — `nextOccurrence` returns `null` once exceeded, spawn becomes a no-op
- [x] Custom repeat rule scaffolding — V0 maps `freq: 'custom'` onto the weekly path; full RRULE support deferred to a later pass
- [x] Hide unimplemented custom-repeat UI from the current product surface

### Phase 8: task details and editing

- [x] Add edit flow for existing tasks — tap a row's body opens the composer in edit mode (`tasksRepo.getTaskGraph` + `ComposerInitial`)
- [x] ~~Add task detail screen or expanded editor~~ — collapsed into the composer's edit mode for V0 (one canvas for create + edit)
- [x] Edit title, category, due date, time, reminder, repeat, and subtasks — all flow through `tasksRepo.updateTaskFull` (single transaction, replaces child rows)
- [x] Delete task flow — trash icon in the composer's action row (edit mode only) with `Alert.alert` confirm; cancels reminders + soft-deletes
- [ ] Duplicate task flow — deferred until there's a long-press menu on rows
- [ ] Preserve completed-task history — already preserved (soft-delete + completed_at); a "Show done" toggle on the home is the missing UI
- [ ] Add richer edit/details presentation inspired by `update_screen.jpeg` — top category chip, cleaner summary rows, and overflow actions
- [ ] Add notes editing
- [ ] Attachment support intentionally deferred out of scope
- [x] Hide unimplemented templates / attachment-related UI from the current product surface

### Phase 9: calendar and views

- [x] Build Calendar tab — see [`app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`](./app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx)
- [x] Add month view with selected-day task list — `CalendarGrid` + filtered `useTasks({ dueAtMin/dueAtMax })` + reused `TaskRow`
- [x] Highlight days that contain tasks — new `tasksRepo.listDueDaysInRange` feeds `CalendarGrid`'s `markedDays` prop (small dot under days with tasks)
- [x] ~~Switch between list and calendar context without losing filters~~ — separate tabs intentionally; the Tasks tab keeps category filter, Calendar keeps day-pick. Cross-context state-sharing deferred unless usage shows it's needed.
- [x] Add quick jump to Today — pill button in the header
- [x] Editor reuse — both tabs share `useTaskEditor` (`src/lib/useTaskEditor.tsx`), so create/edit/delete paths stay in one place
- [x] Add collapse / expand affordance in the calendar header — chevron toggle flips `CalendarGrid` between `mode='month'` (6×7 grid) and `mode='week'` (single 7-cell strip with week-stepping arrows); anchor snaps so the selected day stays visible across mode switches
- [x] ~~Add calendar overflow actions~~ — deferred: a kebab with one item that already exists in the header is busywork. Will revisit when a real second action emerges (e.g. category filter, show-completed-only)
- [x] Refine the selected-day task card styling — small uppercase count label (`3 TASKS` / `NOTHING SCHEDULED`) and friendlier empty state above the list
- [x] Mute past-date cells on the Calendar tab — 0.55 opacity + muted text so they read as historical; still tappable so users can review history. Composer's date picker keeps its hard block (`disablePast=true` default).

### Phase 10: profile and settings

- [x] Build Profile tab as a dashboard surface — see [`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`](./app/(tabs)/profile.tsx)
- [x] Add account state, sign-in status, streak summary, and sign-out — user bar at top, `StreakCounter`, sign-out button at bottom
- [x] ~~Add upgrade banner equivalent~~ — intentionally out of scope; product is fully free
- [x] Add weekly completion chart — `BarChart` (Phase 10 design spec) using `computeWeeklyCompletion`
- [x] Add category breakdown chart — `DonutChart` (SVG via `react-native-svg`) using `computeCategoryBreakdown`
- [x] Migrate `SignInScreen` and `NotificationsScreen` off the deprecated `colors` shim onto `useTheme()` — both screens now follow light/dark via the theme provider
- [x] Delete `src/theme/colors.ts` shim — done
- [x] Add task overview summary cards (totals — total / done / pending / overdue) — `OverviewTotals` card above `StreakCounter` driven by `computeOverviewTotals`
- [x] Add next 7 days summary block — `UpcomingWeek` strip; distinct from the retrospective `BarChart`
- [x] ~~Add notification settings summary~~ — removed. The dev-only test surface and its Profile link have been deleted; the production reminders engine itself (`src/lib/notificationScheduler.ts`) still ships.
- [x] Add category management screen (rename / recolor / delete) — `app/categories.tsx`, reached from "Manage categories" row on Profile
- [x] Add theme/settings scaffold (force-light / force-dark / system toggle, stored in `expo-secure-store`) — `ThemeToggle` segmented control on Profile, persisted under key `theme_preference_v1`
- [ ] Add data export/import placeholder if needed later

### Phase 11: free product guardrails

Current product direction is fully free.

- [x] Keep the shipped product fully free
- [ ] Revisit monetization only if the core product is strong and there is a clear reason to change scope
- [ ] Re-introduce premium-flagged UI only when the underlying features actually exist
- [ ] Re-introduce templates UI when task templates are implemented
- [ ] Re-introduce custom repeat UI when the custom repeat editor exists
- [ ] Re-introduce advanced reminder UI when silent/alarm/screen-lock reminders actually work

### Phase 12: polish and release readiness

- [x] Add onboarding for first launch — see [`app/onboarding.tsx`](./app/onboarding.tsx) (3 swipeable slides, completion stored in `expo-secure-store` via [`src/lib/onboarding.ts`](./src/lib/onboarding.ts), gated in `_layout.tsx`)
- [x] Add animations for composer open/close and task completion — `TaskComposer` now drives a synchronized scrim-fade + sheet-translate via `Animated` (replacing RN's default `slide`); keyboard avoidance composes through `Animated.subtract` so the transform array stays stable. `TaskRow` pulses the checkbox on toggle-to-done and dims the title via animated opacity (strike-through stays static — `textDecorationLine` isn't animatable). First-mount runs are skipped so completed rows don't pulse on scroll-in.
- [x] Improve accessibility for touch targets, labels, and contrast — focused label pass (SignInScreen, SchedulePickerSheet `×` glyphs, CalendarGrid day cells); skipped redundant labels for controls whose visible text already reads through TalkBack. Color-contrast audit shipped: see [`src/theme/CONTRAST_AUDIT.md`](./src/theme/CONTRAST_AUDIT.md). Six failing pairings fixed (`textMuted` light, `warn` on `warnSoft`, `borderStrong` light + dark for checkbox visibility, dark `danger` for overdue date, pinned-row checkbox border). All audited pairings now clear WCAG AA for text and 3:1 for non-text UI.
- [x] Add offline-safe persistence migration plan — see [`src/db/migrations/MIGRATIONS.md`](./src/db/migrations/MIGRATIONS.md). Covers when to add a migration, the safety rules (transaction-wrapped, idempotent, never-edit-shipped), the SQLite-specific rebuild dance for column type/constraint changes, the forward-only policy until Phase 14 backup/restore lands, and a testing checklist.
- [x] Add analytics — Mixpanel integration exists via [`src/lib/analytics.ts`](./src/lib/analytics.ts). Current events cover app opens, onboarding, task actions, category actions, reminder scheduling, and theme changes. Privacy-policy and store disclosures must stay aligned with the shipped data collection.
- [x] Draft Play Store description, privacy policy starter, and release checklist — see [`STORE_COPY.md`](./STORE_COPY.md), [`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md), and [`RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] Capture final Play Store screenshots from the release build
- [ ] Publish the privacy policy and complete the Play Console listing

### Phase 13: collaboration and accountability

- [ ] Add account-backed sync as a prerequisite for collaboration
- [ ] Add friend invite flow via email
- [ ] Add incoming invite acceptance and rejection flow
- [ ] Add friend list management
- [ ] Add assign-to-friend support on tasks
- [ ] Add received-task inbox or assigned-task section
- [ ] Add task activity events for assignment, completion, and updates
- [ ] Add streak comparison or accountability views between connected users
- [ ] Add privacy and permission rules for personal vs assigned tasks
- [ ] Add collaboration notifications for invites, assignments, and completions

### Phase 14: backup, restore, and sync

> **Deferred.** Local-only persistence is sufficient for the current product loop; cloud sync would also be a prerequisite for collaboration (Phase 13), so both move together when revisited.

- [ ] Define canonical JSON export shape across all tables
- [ ] Implement local JSON export with `expo-sharing`
- [ ] Implement JSON import with conflict and version checks
- [ ] Add backup/restore UI in the Profile tab
- [ ] Define server contract for cloud sync
- [ ] Implement cloud sync with last-write-wins or vector-clock strategy

## Current implementation status

- [x] Expo app shell exists
- [x] Android local dev build path exists
- [x] Google sign-in wiring exists
- [x] Local reminders engine ships in production (`src/lib/notificationScheduler.ts`); the standalone dev test screen has been removed
- [x] Streak Todo branding is in place
- [x] Product task system is built
- [x] Calendar experience exists
- [x] Profile dashboard exists
- [ ] Collaboration features are intentionally deferred until the single-user product and sync are stable
